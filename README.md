# Hardware-EEG-FIR-Filter
This project is for BENG 426 with the goal of creating a Hardware-based FIR Filter (and FFT if possible) of a single-channel EEG signal in time-series. This is meant to be run on a Basys3, and will be evaluated for is performance, accuracy loss, and power efficiency compared to microcontroller solutions.
